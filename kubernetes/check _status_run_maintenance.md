# *Check status of nodes in the cluster and run some maintenance tasks*

Situation-
Your company is using Kubernetes to run some of the infrastructure for its 
frontend web portal. There have been a few customer-facing issues overnight. 
You have been asked to check the status of the cluster and perform a few 
maintenance tasks.

I checked the status of the nodes, next the pods, then deleted a pod and created a new one.
